## Note Taking Application

## Description
This is a simple note taking application. Users who access this application can write their notes in the right-hand side of the screen and save them to a local database. Each note has a title and a description section. The title can be used to give a general idea what the note is about while the descrition can be used to elaborate on that note.

Deployed Application: https://rocky-peak-07472-1a628ab26c46.herokuapp.com/

## Installation
This application is already deployed to heroku. To access it the user simply needs to click on the deployed application link above.

## Usage
This application can be used to keep track of any notes that the user may need to write down. For example, if the user has a busy day with a lot of tasks they need to complete, they can write each task as an individual note and include details about each task. Once the user does this, then they only need to click on each note to read more about it. Delete functionality is not complete yet but once it is, the user can then delete each note as they complete each task.

## Project status
This project is still in progress. It still needs a working delete route so that users can delete notes they no longer need.
